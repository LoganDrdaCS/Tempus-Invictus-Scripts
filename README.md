I'm solo developing a game called "Tempus Invictus." This repository only includes the working code for the game. The following resources are not inlcluded:

- Audio
- Video
- Scenes
- Sprites
- All other assets

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the code I have written, nearly from-scratch, for this project of mine.
